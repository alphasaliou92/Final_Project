        <p>With the opening of the Alabama museum of lynching to spread light on lynching in America recently, I decided to share this part of history which is forgotten from the public. People seems to be unaware of the history during this time period. The public will meaninglessly take it gently, as a movie for some, or a theatre for others. For those unfamiliar with lynching, Lynching was a term to describe the execution of a person by a group of men, usually Whites supremacist without trial in justice. Usually the designated felon being a black person, whites supremacist would use lynching as a tool against black people to seed fear into their heart and unable them to rebel and have a free will. Even though lynching has decreased tremendously in the 20th â€“ 21st century, there is still some states were lynching continue to occur.*</p>
